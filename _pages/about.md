Hi, I'm Min-Bin :wave: I'm a Posdoc researcher at the Institute of Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods (AIFB) at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics and Econometrics from the International Research Training Group (IRTG) 1792 "High Dimensional Nonstationary Time Series" at Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin, Germany. I have an MSc in Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM) from the National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan.
My research interests center on 1) blockchain technology and its applications (i.e. cryptos, NFTs) aiming to contribute towards a better understanding towards blockchain technology from dynamical, statistical, and economic perspectives and further solve the problems discovered in the blockchain ecosystem; 2) data science working on devloping data intensive model and large data processing and understanding.
